Candy Land Board Game in C

Candy Land (with a twist). The board will be composed of an unknown number of
"squares" (each "square" data will be read in from a file, which is included).
The board is a collection of these "squares" and is therefore dynamic,
so it uses a Generic Double Linked List to hold each "square".
The entire Generic Double Linked List is the board. This is a single player game,
and you win when you land on the WIN
space.

The code includes one, two, and four player versions.
